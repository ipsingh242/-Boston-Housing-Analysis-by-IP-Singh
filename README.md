# Boston Housing Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Boston housing dataset, which explores various factors influencing property values in the Boston area. 
The dataset includes information such as per capita crime rate, nitric oxide concentrations, average number of rooms per dwelling, and median value of owner-occupied homes.

## Overview

The analysis aims to understand the relationship between different variables in the dataset and their impact on housing prices. Key questions addressed in the analysis include:
- Is there a significant difference in median values of houses bounded by the Charles river compared to those not bounded by it?
- How does the age of properties affect median house values?
- Is there a relationship between nitric oxide concentrations and property values?
- What is the impact of distance to employment centres on median property values?
